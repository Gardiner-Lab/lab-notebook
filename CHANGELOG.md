## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-15

The first release: a digital lab notebook for the Gardiner Lab suite, designed
after Trilium Notes.

### Added
- **Notebooks and days.** Each person's own notebook, with "Start today" (or any date) filing a
  day page under its year and month.
- **Notes in a tree.** Notes are kept apart from their places in the tree, so a note can sit in
  several places. A ＋ beside each note adds a page under it, as in Trilium. Notes can be dragged,
  or moved with "Move to…".
- **Search.** The box at the top of the sidebar (Ctrl+K or /) searches titles and everything written
  in pages and protocols: text, table cells and steps. Matches are highlighted in context.
  `#label` or `#label=value` finds notes by their labels.
- **Protocols tab.** The library has a tab of its own, with search, folders, who wrote each protocol
  and how often it has been used, and "Use today" to put a protocol into today's page.
- **Favourite protocols.** Star a protocol to list it in your sidebar. Favourites come first when
  you add a protocol to a page.
- **Protocol library.** Shared by everyone. A protocol is changed by its author, their lab's lead
  or an administrator. It is put into a day as the version used, and the protocol shows the days
  that used it.
- **Active tables.**
  - Scaling by the number of reactions.
  - Column and cell formulas, with A1 references, ranges and SUM/MIN/MAX/AVERAGE/ROUND/ABS/IF.
  - Fill-in cells.
  - Tick-off cells and steps, stamped with who and when by the server.
- **From MoClo.** The MoClo Golden Gate protocol in the library. Saved MoClo assemblies go into a
  page as reaction tables that work out DNA volumes from concentrations, as MoClo does.
- **Plasmid links.** `@` or the Plasmid button links plasmids from the Plasmid Editor's library,
  and clicking one opens it in the editor.
- **Labels and relations, links and backlinks.**
- **History.** A revision for every change, edits close together kept as one, any version
  restorable. A save from an out-of-date window is held back.
- **Access.** Lab leads read their lab's notebooks and administrators read all of them. Text is
  cleaned on the server, so no page can carry scripts to its readers.
